  <description>Turbine is a servlet based framework that allows experienced Java
    developers to quickly build secure web applications. Parts of Turbine
    can also be used independently of the web portion of Turbine as
    well. In other words, we strive to make portions of Turbine easily
    available for use in other applications.</description>
